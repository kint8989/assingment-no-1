    "The while loop is used in Python when a set of instructions or a block of code needs to be repeated until a certain condition is met. The loop iterates through the block of code repeatedly until the condition becomes false. A while loop can be used when we do not know the number of iterations beforehand, unlike a for loop.\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to take input from the user until they enter a valid number between 1 and 10. We can use a while loop to repeat the input prompt until the user enters a valid number:\n",
    "num = 0\n",
    "while num < 1 or num > 10:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number between 1 and 10: \"))\n",
